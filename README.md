### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated software engineer with a passion for software development and a love for cooking. I have been working in the software industry for several years and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions on time and within budget.

As a lifelong learner, I am always looking for new challenges to take on, and I am currently training on various competitions platforms to hone my skills and prepare for a Principal position. I believe that staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices is essential for success in this rapidly evolving field.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes. I find cooking to be a relaxing and rewarding hobby that allows me to express my creativity and improve my attention to detail. Just like in software development, cooking requires precise measurements and the ability to problem-solve in real-time, making it an excellent complement to my technical skills.

My skills and experience include:Extensive experience in software development using languages such as Python, Java, and C++Strong knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and software design patternsFamiliarity with Agile software development methodologies such as Scrum and KanbanAbility to work collaboratively in a team environment, both in-person and remotely

If you are looking for a software engineer who is passionate about development, highly motivated to succeed, and always eager to learn, I would love to hear from you. I am confident that my combination of technical expertise and positive attitude would make me an excellent addition to your team.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to your organization.
